# MotionBackend
Expanding from the last front-end focused project, in this project we implemented DevOps with Docker and DigitalOcean, and created our own API with Django, Django REST framework and SQLite3. 

"Motion" is a social media application. Users can upload posts with images, connect with friends, or follow the other users and like posts. They can also see their own profile page or the other users' profile pages.

## Accomplished tasks
- Created a DigitalOcean droplet (VMs)
- Wrote Dockerfile for building docker images and containers
- Registered our docker image in Gitlab
- Installed and registered Gitlab runner to our remote virtual server (droplet)
- Configured Gitlab CI/CD, deployed our web application 
- Configured domain name via DigitalOcean
- Set up SSL Certification for encrypted HTTPS connections via Cerbot
- Configured NGINX to work with our domain name
- Connected front-end and back-end using NGINX & Gunicorn
- Created API model diagram via PonyORM
- Created endpoints with Django & Django REST framework
